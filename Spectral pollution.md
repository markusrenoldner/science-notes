# Spectral pollution

#unlinked 

**Goal:** We are interested in the spectrum/eigenvalues of a bounded, self-adjoint or differential operator $H$ acting on an infinite-dim space $\mathcal{H}$. 
The **truncation/Ritz method** is to take a finite-dim test space $\mathcal{L}$ with an orthonormal basis ${\phi_r}$ and to compute the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ given by
$$A_{rs}=\left\langle H\phi_r, \phi_s\right\rangle$$

## Problem: Spectral pollution
$A$ may possess eigenvalues which are unrelated to any spectral properties of $H$.
