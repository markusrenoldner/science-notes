A way to find a necessary condition (CFL$\impliedby$stability, but not $\implies$) for numerical stability (see also [[Convergence, consistency, stability, condition of FDM, Lax richtmayr theorem]] of an approximation using the [[Finite Difference Method (FDM)]].


## In words:
A consistent method can only be stable if the continuous domain of dependence is a subset of the numerical domain of dependence.


## Mathematically:
A condition necessary for stability (see [[Convergence, consistency, stability, condition of FDM, Lax richtmayr theorem]]).

CFL condition:
$$\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}u \leq C$$
