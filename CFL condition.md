A necessary condition for numerical stability (CFL$\impliedby$stability, but not CFL $\implies$ stability).
See also [[Lax equivalence theorem]] of an approximation using the [[Finite Difference Method (FDM)]].


## In words:
A consistent method can only be stable if the continuous domain of dependence is a subset of the numerical domain of dependence.


## Example
CFL condition for FD schemes for the [[Advection equation]]:
$$\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} a \leq 1$$
