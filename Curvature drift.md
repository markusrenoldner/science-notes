We consider charged particles, relevant in [[Plasma physics]].
For motion in static, uniform B-fields: [[Particle motion in uniform magnetic fields]]


Use results from [[E cross B drift]], but assume a "curved" $B$-field. Particles will follow field line. The centrifugal force is $$F_C = \frac{m v_p^2}{R^2_B} R_B$$ and therefore the "curvature drift" is $$v_d = \frac{F_C\times B}{q B^2}=\frac{m v_p^2}{qB^2 R_B^2}(R_B\times B)$$
