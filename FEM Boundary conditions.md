[[Finite Element Method]]


In the variational formulations of 2nd-order elliptic BVPs
- dirichlet BC are directly imposed into the trial space and (in the homogenious case) on the test space
	- in the non homogenious case, the test space is an [[Affine space]]
	- but MEHC primal field macht das nicht so!
- neuman BC are only enforcred through the variational equation


for testfunctions: do not test, where the solution is known, e.g., on the boundary

but then also:
[[Minima of quadratic functionals]]

[[Equivalence of quadratic minimization and variational problem]]


and also: why "for all v in V_0" here ?

#TODO is this correct?
