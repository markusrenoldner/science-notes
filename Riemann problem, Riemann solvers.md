A Riemann problem is a specific initial value problem composed of a conservation euquation together with piecewise constant initial data which has a single discontinuity in the domain of interest. The Riemann problem is very useful for the understanding of conseration laws, because all properties, such as shocks and rarefaction waves, appear as characteristics in the solution. It also gives an exact solution to some complex nonlinear equations, such as the Euler equations (see [Navier-Stokes equations](Navier-Stokes%20equations.md)).

Generally speaking, Riemann solvers are specific methods for computing the numerical flux across a discontinuity in the Riemann problem.

Important examples of Riemann solvers are
- Godunov scheme
- Roe scheme
