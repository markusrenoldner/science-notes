... are numerical methods ([Numerics for differential equations](Numerics%20for%20differential%20equations.md)) that solve a [Conservation law, transport equation](Conservation%20law,%20transport%20equation.md) given as
$$\partial_t u + \nabla \cdot f(u) = g(z)$$
where $u=u(x,t)$ is the unknown function, $f$ is a given flux function and $g$ is a given source function.
