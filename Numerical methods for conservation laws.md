# Numerical methods for conservation laws
... are numerical methods ([[Numerics for differential equations]] that solve a [[Conservation law, transport equation]] given as
$$\partial_t u + \nabla \cdot f(u) = g(z)$$
where $u=u(x,t)$ is the unknown function, $f$ is a given flux function and $g$ is a given source function.
