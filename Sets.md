Sets are a fundamental concept from [[Analysis]], [[Linear algebra]], and [[Differential geometry]].
This is an informal intro to set theory (see [[Axiomatic vs informal set theory]])


## Some definitions:
- open ("offen"): without boundary
- bounded ("beschränkt"): ball with finite radius encloses the set
- complete ("vollständig"): cauchy sequences converge
- compact ("kompakt"): each sequence has convergent subsequences, compact <=> bounded and complete, compact => complete
- connected ("zusammenhängend"): connection between any two points in the set
- simply connected (einfach zusammenhängend): without holes, or rather connected and every closed path is "contractible" (zusammenziehbar) to a point in the set (topological term)
#TODO make it more complete and more detailed, check out Ana2 for TPH
