Sets are a fundamental concept from [[Analysis]], [[Linear algebra]], and [[Differential geometry]].
This is an informal intro to set theory (see [[Axiomatic vs informal set theory]])


## Some definitions:
- open (offen): without boundary
- bounded (beschränkt): ball with finite radius encloses the set
- complete (vollständig): cauchy sequences converge
- compact (kompakt): each sequence has convergent subsequences, compact <=> bounded and complete, compact => complete
- connected (zusammenhängend): connection between any two points in the set
- simply connected (einfach zusammenhängend): without holes, or rather connected and every closed path is "contractible" (zusammenziehbar) to a point in the set (topological term)
