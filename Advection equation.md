The equation
$$\partial_t u + C\partial_x u = f$$
which is a special case of [[Conservation law, transport equation]] with flux $f(u)=u$ or a special case of [[Advection-diffusion equation]] with diffusivity constant $D=0$ and a divergence free velocity $\boldsymbol{v}$ or $\boldsymbol{\beta}$.

In multi D (u still scalar):
$$\partial_t u + \boldsymbol{\beta} \cdot \nabla u = 0$$
which means that the advection equation can be derived from a [[Conservation law, transport equation]] wiht
