[[Differential equations]]

The shallow water equations can be derived from the full Navier-Stokes equations and are as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
h_t+(h v)_x=0 & \text { conservation of volume/mass ( } \rho \text { is constant) } \\
(h v)_t+\left(h v^2+\frac{1}{2} g h^2\right)_x=0 & \text { force/momentum balance in } \mathrm{x} \\
\text { on }(x, t) \in[0, L] \times[0, \infty) &
\end{aligned}
$$
here $h$ is the height of the water, $v$ is the velocity, and $g$ the gravity constant.
