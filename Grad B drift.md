We consider charged particles, relevant in [[Plasma physics]].
For motion in static, uniform B-fields: [[Particle motion in uniform magnetic fields]]


Now assume $\nabla B \perp B$. 
Qualitatively, we will have this motion (due to the non-uniform B-field, the cyclotron radius varies):
![[grad-B-drift.png]]
Without derivation, we get the "grad-B drift" $$v_{\nabla B} = \frac{m}{2B^3} \frac{v_0^2}{q} (B\times \nabla B)$$It holds if 
- "the characteristic scale over which $B$ varies is much larger than the cyclotron radius": $\frac{B}{\nabla B}>>\rho$
- $v_0$ is the part of the velocity, that satisfies the equation of motion under the dominating, constant part of the $B$ field.
