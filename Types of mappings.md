### Homöomorphismus / homeomorphism
Isomorphismus zwischen zwei topologischen Räumen ([[Topology and topological space]]) 


### Diffeomorphismus
Isomorphismus zwischen zwei differenzierbaren Mannigfaltigkeiten. Die Inverse ist ebenfalls differenzierbar.


### Homomorphism ($\neq$ homeomorphism)
is a mapping that preserves "algebraic structures"
assume $f:A \mapsto B$ is a homomorphism, $x,y \in A$ and there is an operation $\odot$ , then 
$$f(x\odot y) = f(x) \odot f(y) $$
wikipedia says: In mathematics, an algebraic structure consists of a nonempty set A (called the underlying set, carrier set or domain), a collection of operations on A (typically binary operations such as addition and multiplication), and a finite set of identities, known as axioms, that these operations must satisfy.
Example of an fundamentyl algebraic structure: Group (see [[Groups, rings and fields]])


### Endomorphism
an homomorphism that maps from a set into itself: $f:A\mapsto A$


### Automorphism
an endomorphism that is an isomorphism
