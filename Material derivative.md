also convective or substantial derivative.

describes the time rate of change of a physical quantity (like heat or momentum) of a material element that is under the influence of a space and time dependent velocity field (=it moves).

Does appear in [[Fluid Dynamics]] .

For a quantity or tensor field $y(x,t)$ the material derivative is
$$\frac{Dy}{Dt} \equiv \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}+ u \cdot \nabla y$$
where $u$ is the velocity field and $\nabla y$ is the "covariant derivative" of the tensor $y$ .
