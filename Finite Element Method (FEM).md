important numerical technique for [[PDE]] in [[Numerics]]


## Idea
The endgoal - like always in [[Numerics]] - is to transfer the [[PDE]] problem into a linear system of equations whose solution approximates the [[PDE]].
This is done by interpolating the unknown function.


## Variational Formulation
see also [[Variational formulation, variational problem]]



Usually, the PDE problem is being transferred into a variational formulation by multiplying by a testfunction and then partially integrating over the domain. This reduces regularity requirements on the unknowns, and forcing terms.
For example, consider the poisson problem:
$$\Delta u = f$$

## Assembly



#TODO idea of FEM, inclusive global assembly, interpolation operators, local-global mapping, reference transformation
