# Finite Element Method (FEM)
important numerical technique for partial  [[Differential equations]]
see also [[Numerics for differential equations]]


## Idea of FEM
Transfer a PDE into a system of linear, algebraic equations whose solution approximates the PDE.
For that, derive a [[Variational problem]] (or [[Mixed variational problem]]) of the PDE(s). 
Its solution is interpolated in a finite dim. function space (e.g. polynomials of degree $n$).
The unknown interpolation coefficients are the approximate solution.

## Application examples
More examples of Finite Elements for the Stokes flow problem, for convection-dominated flows with boundary layer and for the Maxwell problem can be found in section 7 in [1].
