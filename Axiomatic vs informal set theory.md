# Axiomatic vs informal set theory

## Axiomatic set theory
There are several axiomatic set theory systems, e.g. the "Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice" (ZFC).

## Informal set theory
Fortunately, usually it is enough to use "Naive/informal set theory" where it is enough to have an informal understanding of:
- Unions
- intersections
- Cartesian products
- ordered pairs
- subsets
- "is an element of"

Each subarea of mathematics defines some properties of sets differently. You can hope, that these definitions are consistent, or at least special cases of each other:
e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set


## Informal definition of a set
"a set is a collection of elements"

notation in mathematics:
$$ M = \{a,b,c,d\}$$
