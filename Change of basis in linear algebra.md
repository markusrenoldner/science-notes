1. every vector can be represented in every basis (see coordinate vectors)
2. commuting diagram: the change of basis matrix is a composition of coordinate maps + example
3. 2nd method to get this matrix: the coordinate vector of the basisvector i of the first basis with respect to the second basis is the i-th column of the transformation matrix + proof and examples



Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space (finite dimensional) over $K$ (usually $K=\mathbb{R}$ or $K=\mathbb{C}$) with a basis 
$$B=\{\boldsymbol{b}_1, ... \boldsymbol{b}_n\}$$
and a second basis 
$$C=\{\boldsymbol{c}_1, ... \boldsymbol{c}_n\}.$$
Let $v\in V$, then in the basis $B$ we can find the coordinate vector of $v$ with the coordinate map. The vector can be represented in the basis $B$ using:
$$v=\sum_i \lambda_i v_i$$
and its coordinate vector is
$$v_B=K_B(v)=\begin{pmatrix}\lambda_1^B\\\lambda_2^B \\ \vdots \\ \lambda_n^B\end{pmatrix}$$
