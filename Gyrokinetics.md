framework/collection of ideas in study of [[Plasma, Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)]] that assumes that the cyclotron frequency (see [[Particle motion in static uniform magnetic field]]) is very fast, and therefore does not model this fast "gyromotion". Instead, only the motion of the guiding center of the gyromotion is being modelled.
The framework therefore only analyses lower frequencies of the particle motion.
