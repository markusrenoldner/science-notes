# Tensor and vector analysis
Objective: 
- development of mathematics of smooth, "locally flat/linear" structures in higher dimensional spaces, 
- description of these using generalized coordinates, 
- generalization of [[Tensor and multilinear algebra]] and [[Analysis]].


## Topics
- [[Vector analysis identities]]
- [[Coordinate transformation of differential operator in 2D example]]
- [[Laplace operator in polar coordinates in 2D]]
