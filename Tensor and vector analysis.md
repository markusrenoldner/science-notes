Objective: 
- development of mathematics of smooth, "locally flat/linear" structures in higher dimensional spaces, 
- description of these using generalized coordinates, 
- generalization of [[Tensor and multilinear algebra]] and [[Analysis]].


## Topics
- [[Curvilinear and generalized coordinates]]
- [[Polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinates]]
- [[Multidimensional integration]]
- [[Differentiation of scalar and vector fields]]
- [[Coordinate transformation of differential equations]]
- [[Vector analysis identities]]
