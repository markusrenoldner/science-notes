An easy example of [[Numerics for differential equations]] that solves a 2nd order ODE (see [[Differential equations]]. It is symplectic ([[Symplectic ODE integrators]] and conserves the energy of the system.

These 2nd order ODEs arise a lot in [[Classical mechanics]] due to Newtons second law.
There are multiple similar formulations:



kick-drift form:
