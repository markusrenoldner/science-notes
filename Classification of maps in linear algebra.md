# Classification of maps in linear algebra

## Isomorphism
Linear, bijective, continuous map between two sets.

## Homeomorphism
("Hom√∂omorphismus")
Isomorphism between two topological spaces


## Diffeomorphism
Isomorphism between two differentiable manifolds with a differentiable inverse.


## Homomorphism ($\neq$ homeomorphism!)
is a map that preserves "algebraic structures"
assume $f:A \mapsto B$ is a homomorphism, $x,y \in A$ and there is an operation $\odot$ , then 
$$f(x\odot y) = f(x) \odot f(y) $$
wikipedia says: In mathematics, an algebraic structure consists of a nonempty set A (called the underlying set, carrier set or domain), a collection of operations on A (typically binary operations such as addition and multiplication), and a finite set of identities, known as axioms, that these operations must satisfy.
Example of an fundamental algebraic structure: Group (see [[Group]])


## Endomorphism
a homomorphism that maps from a set into itself: $f:A\mapsto A$


## Automorphism
an endomorphism that is an isomorphism
