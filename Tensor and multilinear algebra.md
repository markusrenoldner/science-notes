[[Linear algebra]]


#todo explain relation to these (and maybe simplify the articles or extract the main theorems in a short overview):
- [[Coordinate vectors, coordinate maps]]
- [[Change of basis in linear algebra]]
- [[Transformation matrices, linear maps]]


## Tensor Definition:
1. Object invariant under change of coordinates
2. A number of vectors and covectors combined using the tensor product
3. For curvilinear coordinates (see [[Tensor and vector analysis]]): Partial derivatives and gradients that transform with the Jacobi matrix


## Topics
- [[Vector and covector transformation]]
- [[Tensor transformation]]
- [[Metric tensor]]
- [[Strange tensor algebra result from Prechtl]]
