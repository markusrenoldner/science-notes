(frequency of colliding particles in plasma)

The collision frequency is propoertional to the density of the target, the cross section of the target particles, and the incoming velocity $\nu_{coll}=n_{tar}\cdot  \sigma \cdot v_{in}.$
Collisions are possible 
- with neutrals
$$\nu_{coll}=n_{n} \cdot \pi a_0^2 \cdot  \nu_{th,e}$$
- and "Coulomb collisions" (with other charged particles), which becomes important when the Coulomb interaction energy is at the same order of magnitude as the kinetic energy, i.e. $$\frac{E_{C}}{E_{kin}}=\frac{\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}b}} {m_{e}\nu_{th,e}^2} \approx 1 \implies b\approx \frac{e^2 }{4\pi\epsilon_{0} m_e \nu_{th,e}^2} .$$ and therefore $$\nu_{col} = n_{e} \cdot \pi b^2 \cdot  \nu_{th,e}.$$ Here $b$ is the distance of closest approach:
