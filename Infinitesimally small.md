# Infinitesimally small

This is an excerpt from the section "Interpretation of the derivative" from [1]:

> [...] Notice that we did not take the limit $\delta \to 0$ in the expansions above [...].
>  Instead, we took $\delta$ to be nonzero but “arbitrarily small”. Variables, $\delta$, assuming values smaller than any other in a specific mathematical context are said to be infinitesimally small. The attribute infinitesimal usually implies that a limit $\delta \to 0$ will eventually be taken. Still, it can be advantageous to keep the variable temporarily finite and use its smallness as an aid in computations (ignoring terms of $\mathcal{O}(\delta^2)$, etc.).

Summary:
- First: it means **arbitrarily small**
- Second: it means, eventually we will take $\delta\to 0$, but for the moment, we keep it finite. Still, it is small enough, that we can use a "linear approximation", i.e. taking only terms of $\mathcal{O}(\delta),\mathcal{O}(1)$ into account.
