## Functions

if it is not important
- how the function value is called
- what the function is doing
$$f(x): \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$

if its not important what the domain and target set are:
$$f:(x,y) \mapsto x^2+4y$$

if additionally the domain and target set are important:
$$\begin{align}
f:\mathbb{R}^2 &\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\\
(x,y) &\mapsto x^2+4y
\end{align}$$


## Operators
are maps that map functions to functions. An operator can e.g. map from a vector space into another vector space.

An example is a differential operator $D$. It can be notated as follows:
$$D:C^1(M) \rightarrow C^0(M)$$
where $M$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Another example is a trace operator:
$$T:C^1(M)\rightarrow L^p(\partial M)$$
or e.g.
$$T:W^{1,p}(M)\rightarrow L^p(\partial M)$$
where now $W$ is a Sobolev space and $\partial M$ is the boundary of $M$
