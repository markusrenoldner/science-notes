Let M be a set (see [[Sets]])

A foundational concept of [[Differential geometry]]


We call P(M) the power set, that means it is the set of all subsets of M including the empty set and M itself.

A set O $\subset$ P(M) is called a topology if it satisfies the following properties:
- 0 $\in$ O
- U $\in$ O, V$\in$  $\implies$ $U \cap V \in$ O 
- $U_{\alpha}\in O$, $\alpha \in A$ , where A is an index set meaning $(\cup_{\alpha\in A} U_\alpha ) \in O$ 

The tuple (M, O) is called a topological space.
