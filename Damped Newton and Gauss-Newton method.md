- Damped newton
	- Descent method (find minimum of function)
	- Use descent method to find solution of nonlinear equation: find minimum of $x\mapsto||\boldsymbol{f}(x)||^2_2$  which are the zeros of $\boldsymbol{f}$ 
 - Gauss-Newton: use Newton method to solve nonlinear least squares (compare with: Least squares method)
 - quasi-newton method
	- Broyden method
