A way to find a sufficient condition ($\implies$ but not $\impliedby$) for numerical stability (see also [[Convergence, consistency, stability, condition of FDM, Lax richtmayr theorem]] of an approximation using the [[Finite Difference Method (FDM)]].

only linear problems with const coeff
Von Neumann analysis can only handle periodic boundary conditions or no boundaries.
