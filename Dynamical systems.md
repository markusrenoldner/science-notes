# Dynamical systems
studies stability and chaotic behaviour of (nonlinear) ODEs, see [[Differential equations]]


- "dynamical" implies a dependence of time (or a similar evolutionary variable) of the underlying equations
- "nonlinear" implies, that the evolution rule (e.g. a differential equation for continuous systems) appears in a "nonlinear way" in the differential equation (the differential equation is nonlinear in the unknown function)


An popular example of a dynamic system is the [[Lorenz attractor]].
