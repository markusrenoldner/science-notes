studies stability and chaotic behaviour of (usually nonlinear) [[ODE]]s

"dynamical" implies a dependence of time (or a similar evolutionary variable) of the underlying equations
"nonlinear" implies, that the evolution rule (e.g. a differential equation for continuous systems) appears in a "nonlinear way" in the differential equation (the differential equation is nonlinear in the unknown function)
An interesting example of a dynamic system is the [[Lorenz attractor]].
