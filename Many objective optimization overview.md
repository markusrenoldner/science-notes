The review paper [[karami,dariane-Overview_Many_Objective_Optimization.pdf]] gives an overview of the 32 most important techniques in many objective optimization.


## Definitions:
problems with two or three objective functions are known as Multi-Objective Problems (MOP)
problems with four or more objective functions are known as Many-Objective Problems (MaOP).


## Classification:
They classify the optimisation approaches into 
1. mathematical, 
2. non-Pareto and 
3. Pareto techniques for Multi-Objective problems, 
4. Many-Objective approaches and 
5. auxiliary methods that can be added to various algorithms to improve their performance.


## Mathematical techniques
The mathematical techniques include the use of linear and non-linear optimisation methods, the use of gradient and Hessian matrix-based methods, the use of dynamical systems and the use of stochastic methods.
Dynamic systems are used in Multi-Objective Optimisation to approximate the Pareto front. 


## Pareto techniques
Pareto techniques are a type of optimisation techniques based on the Pareto front. The Pareto front is a set of solutions that cannot be dominated. Pareto techniques are used to approximate the Pareto front and find an optimal solution.

The Pareto front is the set of solutions that cannot be dominated. In Multi-Objective Optimisation, the Pareto front is the set of solutions that represents the best trade-off between the different objectives

In Pareto evolutionary techniques, non-domination ranking is used to move the population toward the final solution. Non-domination ranking is a method of ranking solutions in a population based on their non-domination level. A solution is said to dominate another solution if it is better in at least one objective and not worse in any other objective. Non-dominated solutions are those that are not dominated by any other solution in the population


## Non-Pareto techniques
Non-Pareto methods are methods that are not based on the Pareto front. These methods use scalarisation to integrate the different objectives into a single objective.
