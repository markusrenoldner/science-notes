# Minima of functionals solve variational problems
in particular, we discuss the [[Minimum of quadratic functionals]] and its equivalence to a [[Variational problem]] on an [[Affine space]].


## Equivalence theorem from Prof. Hiptmair's lecture

![[equivalence-quadrmin-variational.png]]
this theorem is formulated on a vector space, but also works on an affine space as visible in [[Minimum of quadratic functionals]]


## Proof
see numpde hiptmair
