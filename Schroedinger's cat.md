# Schroedinger's cat

In [1], the author claims that the fact that the atom is decayed and not decayed at the same time implies that the cat is both alive and dead at the same time and that this connection of the "micro cosmos" and "macro cosmos" is the most fundamental problem of modern physics.

In [2], Zeilinger says that the movie makes a mistake by claiming that a superposition between several states implies that the object is really in each of these states simultaneously. To explain the thought experiment correctly: the information whether the atom is decayed does not exist. This is also true for the cat, if one assumes it is a quantum object. 

The problem is not that the cat is macroscopic. The problem with the cat is, that if one isolates it completely from its environment, it dies, which is necessary to consider the cat "a quantum object". In reality that cat is not a quantum object and interacts with its environment, which means that the information about the cat state exists (and is available e.g. for an observer in the box).

The "paradox" is only a paradox if we wrongly assume that objects in superpositions are in all states simultaneously. This is called "reification".
