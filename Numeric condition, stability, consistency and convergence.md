[[Lax equivalence theorem]]
Condition number, see [[Numerical analysis]]


Let
- $f(x)$ be the mathematical problem depending on the input $x$
- $\tilde{f}$ be the numerical algorithm
- $\tilde{x}$ the perturbed input data

$\|f(\tilde{x})-f(x)\|$ condition: how much does the problem vary under perturbation?
$\|\tilde{f}(\tilde{x})-\tilde{f}(x)\|$ Stability: How much does the numerical algorithm vary under perturbation?
$\|\tilde{f}(x)-f(x)\|$ Consistency: How well does the algorithm (with exact input) actually solve the problem?
$\|\tilde{f}(\tilde{x})-f(x)\|$ Convergence: How well does the perturbed algorithm actually solve the problem?
