[[Analysis]]


## Topics:
- [[Function and operator notation]]
- Spaces: normed, Banach, Hilbert
- The space $C^m$
- The space $L^p$

## Lp spaces

#todo mention that "L2 spaces with norm" are defined using [[Equivalence class, quotient space]]. This implies that point values of functions in that space have no meaning. Two functions that only differ on intervals/sets with measure zero (like e.g. points), are equal in the "L2-sense".

### $L^2$


## Sobolev spaces

### $H^1$
is defined as $H^1:=\{u\in L^2: \nabla u\in L^2\}$
$H1$ functions are continuous! Otherwise the weak differentiability would not work!

### $H^1_0$
is defined as $H^1:=\{u\in H^1: tr(u)=0 \text{ on } \partial \Omega\}$

### $H^{-1}$ 
is the dual space of $H^1_0$ , i.e. it contains linear functionals/covectors map from $H_0^1\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ 

### H(curl)
is defined as $H(curl):=\{u\in L^2: \nabla\times u\in L^2\}$
