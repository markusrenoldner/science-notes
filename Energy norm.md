If $a$ is an inner product (symmetric, pos. def. bilinear form), an a real vector space $V$ then
$$||v||:=a(v,v)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
defines a norm.

If $a(v,v)$ is the bilinearform of a quadratic functional (see [Minimum of quadratic functionals](Minimum%20of%20quadratic%20functionals.md)) , the the norm is called energy norm.

the term “energy norm” is inspired by the quadratic potential energy functionals as they occur in many mathematical models
