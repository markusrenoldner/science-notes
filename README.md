This is a collection of notes on [[Physics]] and [[Mathematics]] in the form of markdown and PDF files.

Markdown notes are linked together using Wikilinks "[[]]". This allows to use the freely available software Obsidian (available at https://obsidian.md/) to visualize the emerging graph/network of files. Obsidian also allowes to see backlinks, i.e. to see which other notes link to the current one, and makes all note contents searchible.
