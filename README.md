This is a collection of markdown-based notes on [[Physics]] and [[Mathematics]].

The notes/files are linked together using Wikilinks "[[]]". This allows to open the files in Markdown-based note taking apps, like Obsidian and to visualize the notes as a graph/network. The note collection becomes a digital encyclopedia, like Wikipedia.
