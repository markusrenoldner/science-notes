This is a collection of notes on [[Physics]] and [[Mathematics]] containing 2 types of files:
1. markdown files on single/atomic ideas
2. PDF files on collections of ideas, tagged with #notes

Concepts that should not accidentally appear twice (e.g. in a PDF and in a MD note).

Markdown notes are linked together using the filename within double square brackets "[[]]". This allows to use the freely available software tool Obsidian to visualize the emerging graph/network of files. Obsidian also allowes to see "linked mentions", i.e. to see which other notes link to the current one.
