# Field (Algebra)
[[Linear algebra]]
in german "KÃ¶rper"


## Definition based on rings, see [[Ring (Algebra)]]
A field is a unitary ring where each nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. More explicit:
A tuple $(K, +, \cdot ,0,1)$ where
$$\begin{aligned}
+ &: K\times K \rightarrow K \\
\cdot &: K\times K \rightarrow K
\end{aligned}$$
and where $K$ is a set, is called field if
- $K$ together with addition is an abelian group with neutral element $0$
- $K \backslash \{0\}$ together with multiplication is an abelian group, see [[Group]] with neutral element $1$


## Definition based on axioms
A tuple $(K, +, \cdot ,0,1)$ where
$$\begin{aligned}
+ &: K\times K \rightarrow K \\
\cdot &: K\times K \rightarrow K
\end{aligned}$$
and where $K$ is a set, is called field if the following axioms hold
- associativity, commutativity, existence of neutral element, and existence of inverse element of addition
- associativity, commutativity, existence of neutral element, and existence of inverse element of multiplication
- distributivity of addition and multiplication
- \item $1\neq 0$


## Some properties
- Every field has at least two elements
- $0\cdot a = 0$
- Fields dont have zero divisors, in other words: $a\cdot b= 0 \implies a=0 \vee b=0$
- $a\cdot (-b) = -(a\cdot b)$ and $(-a)\cdot (-b) = a\cdot b$
- $x\cdot a = y\cdot a $ with $a\neq 0 \implies x=y$
