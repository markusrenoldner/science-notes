a field that combines [Fluid Dynamics](Fluid%20Dynamics.md) and [Electrodynamics](Electrodynamics.md) to describe ionized Fluids/Plasmas.

## Definition of a plasma
Plasma is an ionized, globally neutral (="quasi neutral") gas that displays collective effects.

To understneed that, we need 3 definitions:
- [Plasma Debye length](Plasma%20Debye%20length.md)
- [Plasma frequency](Plasma%20frequency.md)
- [Plasma collision frequency](Plasma%20collision%20frequency.md)

The definition above implies the following:
- globally neutral $\implies$ size of plasma larger than Debye length
- collective effects
	- $\implies$ one-to-one interactions weak, $N_D>>1$ 
	- $\implies$ $\displaystyle\frac{\omega_{pe}}{\nu_{col}} = \sqrt{\frac{n_0 e^2}{\epsilon_0 m_e}} \frac{1}{n_{e} \cdot \pi b^2 \cdot  \nu_{th,e}}= \dots =16\pi N_D$  which is "large". That means, the plasma frequency is larger than the collision frequency
