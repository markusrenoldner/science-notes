a field that combines [[Fluid Dynamics]] and [[Electrodynamics]] to describe ionized Fluids/Plasmas.

## Definition of a plasma
Plasma is an ionized, globally neutral (="quasi neutral") gas that displays collective effects.

To understneed that, we need 3 definitions:
- [[Plasma Debye length]]
- [[Plasma frequency]]
- [[Plasma collision frequency]]

The definition above implies the following:
- globally neutral $\implies$ size of plasma larger than Debye length
- collective effects
	- $\implies$ one-to-one interactions weak, $N_D>>1$ 
	- $\implies$ $\displaystyle\frac{\omega_{pe}}{\nu_{col}} = \sqrt{\frac{n_0 e^2}{\epsilon_0 m_e}} \frac{1}{n_{e} \cdot \pi b^2 \cdot  \nu_{th,e}}= \dots =16\pi N_D$  which is "large". That means, the plasma frequency is larger than the collision frequency


## Motion of single particles
- [[Particle motion in static uniform magnetic fields]]
- [[Particle motion in electromagnetic fields]]
- [[Plasma confinement]]


## Kinetic description of plasma
Instead of single particles, we have to study many particles that itself influence the $B$ and $E$-fields, using statistical methods.
We discuss the Vlasov equation etc.
[[Kinetic plasma model, Boltzmann equation]]
[[Vlasov equation]]

For a more detailed derivation of the collision frequency, see EPFL lecture 2b)

- plasma resistivity

## Fluid description of plasma
the kinetic model is very accurate, but sometimes too complex.
the fluid model is 3dimensional instead of 6dimensional
we discuss:
- 2-fluid model (treating electron and ions as different fluids)
- MHD model (single fluid!)
