## Definition of a plasma
Plasma is an ionized, globally neutral (="quasi neutral") gas that displays collective effects.

To understneed that, we need 3 definitions:
- [[Plasma Debye length]]
- [[Plasma frequency]]
- [[Plasma collision frequency]]

The definition above implies the following:
- globally neutral $\implies$ size of plasma larger than Debye length
- collective effects
	- $\implies$ one-to-one interactions weak, $N_D>>1$ 
	- $\implies$ $\displaystyle\frac{\omega_{pe}}{\nu_{col}} = \sqrt{\frac{n_0 e^2}{\epsilon_0 m_e}} \frac{1}{n_{e} \cdot \pi b^2 \cdot  \nu_{th,e}}= \dots =16\pi N_D$  which is "large". That means, the plasma frequency is larger than the collision frequency
