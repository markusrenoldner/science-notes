# Physics
Prof. Mikhail Lemeshko defines physics as the unique scientific discipline that tries to gain understanding based on the interplay of experiments and [[Mathematics]]. A Biologist observing how the color of cats gets inherited to their children and utilizing mathematical language to describe this phenomenon a posteriori, or predict the outcome of it a priori can therefore be regarded a physicist. This makes physics the only discipline in natural science that is defined solely on the method and not the object of study.
